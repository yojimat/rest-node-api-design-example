# CrossFit Training Application

REST API inspired by this a tutorial of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rest-api-design-best-practices-build-a-rest-api/#our-example-project). A CRUD application for the workouts of the day. The workouts can have tips on how to perform it.  
It is a [Client-Server-Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) distributed application.
Also try to follow these [principles](https://restfulapi.net/security-essentials) when implementing the security part of the API
